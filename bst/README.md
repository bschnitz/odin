## Binary Search Tree

### Check it out

```sh
ruby main.rb
```

### What I wouldn't tell my Psychologist or anyone else ...

Of course it was quite a joy to implement a binary search tree in ruby. However I got stuck with it for quite a while, because I wanted to develope a nice pretty printing method for displaying the tree top to bottom. Another pretty print was already provided by one of the folks of the community (see Credits), but I thought: Nah, I can do better! There I was stuck with my kind of narcisstic perfectionism. I tried it several times and everytime the code got ugly at some point of my journey and I had to withdraw, because of other business, I had to attend to.

Finally I got it right. I'm still pretty proud about this ridiculous archievement; I hope noone will ever find out.

Well I learned a lesson. Nothing to new, I knew it before ... . **Never put all your effort into something which isn't relevant at the end.** Of course You decide yourself, what is relevant and what not. I would definitetly do it again!

On the other hand, the invested time was well put. I learned a lot about ruby, especially Enumerators, which are quite fun.

### TODO

I really wanted to implement an AVLTree subclass, but since I put so much effort in this pettiness of outputting a nicely formatted tree, I decided to leave this open for a future me, maybe ... . Also replacing main.rb with some rspec tests would possibly be a good lesson.

### Credits

Credits go to the [The odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) which provides great courses for self teaching ruby, ruby on rails and other web-developement related techniques. I like it, check it out!

Now how do You like my tree? Isn't it beautiful. - Gosh! Could someone put some clothes in the mouth of this narcisstic jerk?
